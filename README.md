# LLM-Watermark

#Watermarking the output of a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT involves embedding a unique, hard-to-detect pattern in the text to trace its origin and prevent misuse. This project explores a simple example of #watermarking by manipulating letter frequencies in generated sentences. The goal is to identify which of ten sentences contains a watermark, using the chi-squared goodness of fit statistic and the #"letter_frequencies.csv" dataset. Nine sentences are from actual English text, while one is watermarked by an LLM.
